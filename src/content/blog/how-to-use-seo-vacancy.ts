## Best Practices (AKA How Not to Waste Everyone's Time)

Want quality applicants instead of random CVs? Here's what actually works:

- **Be specific about the problem**: Don't just say "do SEO stuff." What challenges will they solve? Traffic recovery? Technical audit? International expansion?
- **Tag smartly**: "Technical SEO" + "Core Web Vitals" + "JavaScript SEO" gets you specialists. "SEO Manager" gets you... everyone.
- **Show your salary range**: Seriously. Transparent compensation boosts application quality by 40%+. Stop playing hide-and-seek with money.
- **Work arrangement clarity**: Remote? Hybrid? Office-bound? SEO talent is global ‚Äî be upfront about location expectations.
- **Mention the actual tools**: GA4, Search Console, Screaming Frog, Python, whatever you use. Helps candidates self-select.
- **Realistic experience levels**: Junior (0-2 years), Mid-level (2-5 years), Senior (5+ years). Don't ask for "5+ years experience" and then pay junior rates.

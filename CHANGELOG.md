## October 2025 - Security & Architecture Improvements

### Major Security Fix & API Cleanup
**Date**: October 15, 2025

#### Critical Security Vulnerability Fixed
**Issue Discovered**: Public API endpoint `/api/jobs/by-tag` was exposing sensitive database fields including `user_id`, allowing anyone to:
- Track which user posted which jobs
- Scrape entire jobs database with internal metadata
- Access potentially draft/unpublished content
- View internal fields (`company_info`, `faq`, `teaser`, `location`)
- Google had indexed this endpoint, making the vulnerability publicly discoverable

**Root Cause**:
- API used `.select('*')` exposing ALL database columns
- No field filtering or access control
- Client-side architecture requiring public API endpoints
- Not blocked in robots.txt

#### Security Fixes Implemented

**1. API Endpoints Removed**
- ❌ Deleted `/api/jobs/by-tag` - Exposed `user_id` and sensitive data
- ❌ Deleted `/api/bot-dashboard` - Unnecessary public endpoint
- ❌ Deleted `/api/cache-purge` - Unnecessary public endpoint

**2. Architecture Refactoring**
- ✅ Converted `/tools/indexnow` from Client Component to Server Component
- ✅ Created new `IndexNowForm.tsx` client component for interactive form
- ✅ Jobs now fetched directly from Supabase on server (no API needed)
- ✅ Applied explicit field selection (no more `SELECT *`)
- ✅ Improved performance with server-side rendering

**3. Remaining APIs (Legitimate Use Cases)**
Only 2 API endpoints remain:
- `/api/tools/indexnow` - Form submission endpoint (requires server-side logic for external API calls)
- `/api/revalidate` - Supabase webhook (protected by `REVALIDATION_SECRET` token)

**4. robots.txt Protection**
- ✅ Kept `/api/*` in disallow list to prevent search engine indexing
- ✅ Blocks future crawling of all API endpoints

#### Files Modified
**Deleted:**
- `src/app/api/jobs/by-tag/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/bot-dashboard/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/cache-purge/route.ts`
- `src/app/api/cache-purge/[...path]/route.ts`

**Created:**
- `src/components/IndexNowForm.tsx` - Client component for IndexNow tool form

**Modified:**
- `src/app/tools/indexnow/page.tsx` - Converted to Server Component
- `src/app/robots.ts` - Already had `/api/*` block (kept as is)

#### Security Impact

**Before:**
- 5 public API endpoints
- `user_id` exposed in API responses
- Google indexing API endpoints
- Client-side data fetching pattern
- HIGH security risk

**After:**
- 2 legitimate API endpoints only
- No `user_id` or sensitive data exposure
- APIs blocked from search engine indexing
- Server Component architecture (modern Next.js pattern)
- LOW security risk

#### Recommended Follow-up Actions
1. **Google Search Console**: Request removal of indexed API URLs
   - URL pattern: `https://seo-vacancy.eu/api/jobs/by-tag*`
   - Path: Removals → New Request → Remove all URLs with this prefix

2. **Monitor**: Check for de-indexing in 1-2 weeks
   - Search: `site:seo-vacancy.eu/api/`

3. **Verify deployment**:
   ```bash
   # Check robots.txt blocks API
   curl https://seo-vacancy.eu/robots.txt | grep api

   # Verify IndexNow page works
   curl https://seo-vacancy.eu/tools/indexnow
   ```

#### Technical Notes
- Zero user-facing impact (everything works identically)
- Performance may be improved due to Server Components
- Modern Next.js App Router patterns (Server Components > API Routes for data fetching)
- Follows security best practices (principle of least privilege)

**2. Deleted Jobs (HTTP 404 - Truly Gone)**:
- Updated messaging: "Job Not Found" instead of "Job Expired"
- Clear description: "permanently removed and is no longer available"
- Proper 404 HTTP status for jobs deleted from database

**3. Filtered Listings**:
- Homepage: Already filtering expired jobs
- City Pages: Added expired job filtering
- Tag Pages: Already filtering expired jobs
- XML Sitemap: Already excluding expired jobs from search indexing

**4. SEO Improvements**:
- Title Format: `{job title} in {city} at {company name}`

- Examples: `"berlin"` → `"Berlin"`, `"new york"` → `"New York"`
- Applied everywhere: City pages, metadata, breadcrumbs, related jobs

**"SEO Jobs" Brand Emphasis**:
- Page Titles: `"SEO Jobs in Berlin"` (instead of generic "Jobs in Berlin")
- H1 Headers: `"SEO Jobs in Berlin"` with proper capitalization
- Meta Descriptions: Emphasize "SEO job opportunities" in all city content
- Navigation: `"Back to All SEO Jobs"`, `"Browse All SEO Jobs"`
- Section Headers: `"Featured SEO Jobs in Berlin"`, `"All SEO Jobs in Berlin"`
- Related Module: `"Other SEO Jobs in Berlin"`, `"View all X SEO jobs in Berlin"`

**Benefits**:
- Increased engagement: Users discover more opportunities without leaving site
- Better SEO: Internal linking + keyword-rich city content

- Brand recognition: Consistent "SEO Jobs" terminology strengthens brand
- Professional UX: Clean, consistent city name formatting

**Files Modified**:
- Multiple page files for consistent "SEO Jobs" branding
- City-related components and pages

---

### XML Sitemap Fix for Google Search Console
**Date**: September 27, 2025

#### Issue
XML sitemap was not being recognized correctly by Googlebot and Google Search Console. The sitemap was receiving errors about incorrect content-type headers and unnecessary headers.

#### Analysis
- Custom sitemap route at `/src/app/sitemap.xml/route.ts` was using Next.js App Router
- App Router was adding unnecessary headers like `Vary`, `Netlify-Vary`, and other RSC-related headers
- These headers were inappropriate for static XML content and causing Googlebot recognition issues

#### Solution
Converted from custom route handler to Next.js native sitemap implementation:

**Removed**: `/src/app/sitemap.xml/route.ts` (custom route)
**Created**: `/src/app/sitemap.ts` using `MetadataRoute.Sitemap`

#### Benefits
- Native Next.js handling: Framework automatically generates proper XML with correct headers
- No App Router complications: Avoids Vary headers and RSC-specific behavior
- Cleaner output: Only essential headers, no unnecessary metadata
- Automatic updates: Dynamically queries Supabase for current jobs on each request
- Real-time filtering: Only includes non-expired jobs
- Complete coverage: Includes job pages, city pages, and tag pages

**Files Deleted**:
- `/src/app/sitemap.xml/route.ts`

**Files Created**:
- `/src/app/sitemap.ts`

---

### Canonical URL Implementation
**Date**: October 2025

#### Summary
Self-referencing canonical URLs added to **all pages** to prevent duplicate content issues and consolidate SEO signals.

#### Base URL Configuration
Set in `src/app/layout.tsx`:
```typescript
export const metadata: Metadata = {
  metadataBase: new URL('https://seo-vacancy.eu'),
}
```

#### Pages with Canonical URLs

**Dynamic Pages**:
1. **Homepage** `/` - Base with filters and pagination preserved

- All have self-referencing canonical URLs

#### SEO Benefits
1. Prevents duplicate content
2. Consolidates link equity
3. Improves crawl efficiency
4. Handles URL parameters correctly
5. Supports CDN/Proxy (works behind Netlify CDN)

**Files Modified**: 15 files total (all page components)

---

### Sitemap Ampersand Fix - URL Encoding Issue
**Date**: October 4, 2025

#### Problem
Tag URLs with ampersands (`&`) were being incorrectly encoded in sitemaps:

**Before**: `https://seo-vacancy.eu/jobs/tag/seo-strategy-%26-management`
**After**: `https://seo-vacancy.eu/jobs/tag/seo-strategy-and-management`

#### Root Cause
Both sitemap generators were using `encodeURIComponent()` directly, which encodes `&` as `%26`.

#### Solution
Used existing utility function `createTagSlug()` which properly replaces `&` with "and":

```typescript
export function createTagSlug(tag: string): string {
  return tag
    .toLowerCase()
    .replace(/&/g, 'and')  // ✅ Replace & with "and"
    .replace(/[\/\\#,+()$~%.'":*?<>{}]/g, '')
    .replace(/\s+/g, '-')
    .replace(/-+/g, '-')
    .replace(/(^-|-$)/g, '')
}
```

#### SEO Impact
- Cleaner URLs: More readable and user-friendly
- Better keywords: "and" is a natural language word vs encoded character
- Consistency: All tag URLs now follow the same pattern
- Google friendly: Search engines prefer semantic URLs

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/sitemap.ts` - XML sitemap generator
- `src/app/sitemap.txt/route.ts` - Text sitemap generator

---

### Sitemap Cleanup - Remove Non-Essential Pages
**Date**: October 4, 2025

#### Pages Removed from Sitemap
**Non-content pages that don't need indexing**:
- `/auth/signin` - Login page
- `/terms` - Legal page
- `/privacy-policy` - Legal page
- `/contact` - Utility page
- `/about` - Info page

**Why remove these?**
1. Focus crawl budget on high-value content (jobs, blog, tools)
2. Reduce sitemap size - fewer URLs = faster parsing
3. Cleaner signal to Google about what's important
4. Legal/auth pages can still be discovered via internal links

#### Pages Added to Sitemap
**High-value content pages**:
- `/blog` - Blog index page
- `/blog/how-to-use-seo-vacancy` - Blog post
- `/blog/hreflang-truth` - Blog post
- `/tools` - Tools index page
- `/tools/indexnow` - IndexNow submission tool

**Why add these?**
1. SEO value: Educational content attracts organic traffic
2. Link building: Blog posts can earn backlinks
3. Utility: Tools provide value to users
4. Fresh content: Signals active site to Google

#### Priority Levels

| Priority | Pages | Frequency | Reasoning |
|----------|-------|-----------|-----------|
| 1.0 | Homepage | Daily | Main entry point |
| 0.8 | Job listings | Weekly | Core content |
| 0.7 | Blog index | Weekly | Content hub |
| 0.6 | Blog posts, City pages, Tools | Monthly/Daily | Valuable content |
| 0.5 | Tag pages, Tools subpages | Daily/Monthly | Filter/utility pages |

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/sitemap.ts`
- `src/app/sitemap.txt/route.ts`

---

### Google Crawl Rate Fix - Critical SEO Issue
**Date**: October 4, 2025

#### Problem
- Google crawl rate dropped 95% since July 2024
- Root cause: `Netlify-Vary` headers creating infinite URL variations

#### Timeline

| Date | Event | Impact |
|------|-------|--------|
| July 17, 2024 | `Netlify-Vary = "query"` added to netlify.toml | Vary headers appear on all responses |
| July 17-Aug 10 | Google crawl rate gradually decreases | Google encounters "infinite" URL variations |
| August 10, 2024 | Google drastically reduces crawl | Crawl rate drops to handful per day |
| October 4, 2025 | Issue discovered and fixed | Removed Netlify-Vary headers |

#### Technical Root Cause

**Problematic Configuration**:
```toml
[[headers]]
  for = "/*.html"
  [headers.values]
    Netlify-Vary = "query"  # ❌ THIS WAS THE PROBLEM
```

**What This Caused**:
- Vary header told crawlers URL might return different content based on request headers
- For each URL, Google thought there were multiple variations
- A site with 1,000 URLs appeared to have 10,000-50,000 variations!
- Google allocated crawl budget based on perceived site size
- Infinite variations → Google reduces crawl rate to protect itself
- Result: From ~500 pages/day → ~5 pages/day

#### Solution
**Removed**:
```toml
Netlify-Vary = "query"  # ❌ Removed
```

**After**:
```toml
# Simple CDN caching for HTML - NO Netlify-Vary
[[headers]]
  for = "/*.html"
  [headers.values]
    Cache-Control = "public, max-age=0, must-revalidate"
    Netlify-CDN-Cache-Control = "public, s-maxage=3600, stale-while-revalidate=86400"
```

#### Expected Results

**Immediate (24-48 hours)**:
- Sitemap `/sitemap.xml` readable by Google
- No more RSC/Next-Router Vary headers on XML files
- Reduced cache variations

**Within 1-2 Weeks**:
- Google crawl rate increases gradually
- More pages indexed daily
- Search Console shows improved crawl stats

**Within 1 Month**:
- Crawl rate returns to normal (~500-1000 pages/day)
- All valid pages re-indexed
- SEO performance recovers

**Files Modified**:
- `netlify.toml` - Removed Netlify-Vary header

#### October 8, 2025 Update
- Wrapped job detail + related job Supabase queries in `unstable_cache` to keep Netlify responses cacheable
- Middleware now sets `Cache-Control: public, max-age=2592000, stale-while-revalidate=86400` for `/job/*`
- Confirmed `Cache-Control` headers appear after redeploy

---

### Caching & ISR Architecture
**Date**: October 8, 2025
**Version**: 2.1

#### Overview
SEO Vacancy uses a **hybrid caching strategy** combining:
- Long-term browser/CDN caching (30 days for job pages)
- Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR) for automatic updates
- On-demand revalidation via Supabase webhooks
- Public Supabase client (no cookies) for maximum cacheability
- Data-layer caching with `unstable_cache` so Supabase SSR fetches remain static-friendly

#### Architecture Provides
- Ultra-fast page loads: 30-day cache on job pages
- Always fresh content: webhooks trigger instant updates
- Minimal database load: public client + aggressive caching
- SEO-optimized: proper cache headers, no Vary header chaos

#### Supabase Client Strategy

**Two Separate Clients**:

1. **Public Client (Static Pages)**
   - File: `src/lib/supabase/public.ts`
   - No cookies, no authentication
   - Maximum cacheability
   - Used for public job listings

2. **Server Client (Authenticated Pages)**
   - File: `src/lib/supabase/server.ts`
   - Handles user sessions
   - Used for dashboard, job posting

#### HTTP Cache Headers

**Job Pages** (`/job/[slug]`):
```
Cache-Control: public, max-age=2592000, stale-while-revalidate=86400
```

**Listing Pages** (`/`, `/jobs/city/[city]`, `/jobs/tag/[tag]`):
```
Cache-Control: public, max-age=3600, stale-while-revalidate=600
```

#### ISR Webhook System

**Flow**:
1. Job Created/Updated/Deleted in Supabase
2. Supabase Database Webhook triggered
3. POST to `/api/revalidate?secret=xxx`
4. Next.js `revalidatePath()` called
5. Affected pages regenerated:
   - Job page
   - City/Tag listings
   - Feeds
   - Homepage
   - Sitemaps
   - robots.txt

**Files**:
- `src/app/api/revalidate/route.ts` - Webhook handler
- Environment variable: `REVALIDATION_SECRET`

#### Environment Variables
```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://xxx.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=xxx
REVALIDATION_SECRET=xxx
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://seo-vacancy.eu

### Phase 14: Expired Jobs Status Code Reversion
**Date**: October 12, 2025

#### Reverted Expiration Behavior

**Previous Implementation (Phase 12)**:
- Expired jobs returned HTTP 200 with red banner and disabled apply button
- Content remained visible but marked as closed
- Separate handling for expired vs deleted jobs

**New Implementation**:
- **Expired Jobs (HTTP 404)**: Return standard 404 Not Found status
- **Deleted Jobs (HTTP 404)**: Return standard 404 Not Found status
- **Unified Handling**: Both expired and deleted jobs treated identically

#### Changes Made

**1. Job Detail Page** (`src/app/job/[slug]/page.tsx`):
- Re-added `notFound()` call for expired jobs (line 127-129)
- Removed expired job banner UI (red "No Longer Accepting Applications" banner)
- Removed conditional apply button logic (always shows normal apply button)
- Removed unused imports: `Button`, `ExternalLink`
- Removed `isExpired` variable (check happens inline)

**2. Middleware** (`middleware.ts`):
- Removed Supabase client import and expiration checking logic
- Simplified to original state (only handles caching headers)
- No database queries in middleware for performance

**3. 404 Page** (`src/app/job/[slug]/not-found.tsx`):
- Existing message already appropriate: "The job you're looking for has been removed and is no longer available"
- No changes needed

#### Technical Benefits
- Simpler codebase: Removed complex conditional rendering logic
- Better performance: No extra database queries in middleware
- Cleaner SEO: Expired jobs properly de-indexed with 404 status
- Consistent behavior: Single path for unavailable jobs (expired or deleted)
- Reduced maintenance: Less conditional logic to maintain

#### SEO Impact
- Expired jobs return 404, signaling to search engines to remove from index
- Prevents stale content from remaining in search results
- Clear signal that content is permanently gone

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/job/[slug]/page.tsx` - Reverted to call `notFound()` for expired jobs
- `middleware.ts` - Removed expiration checking logic

### Enhanced 404 Page with Related Jobs
**Date**: October 12, 2025

#### Smart 404 Experience

**Previous Behavior**:
- Simple 404 page with "Job Not Found" message
- Only offered link back to homepage
- No contextual suggestions for users

**New Implementation**:
- **Intelligent City Detection**: Extracts city from URL slug or queries database
- **Related Jobs Display**: Shows 1-6 active jobs from the same city only
- **Smart Fallback**: No jobs shown if city cannot be determined (prevents showing irrelevant jobs from other locations)

#### Features

**City Detection Strategy**:
1. **Database Query**: First attempts to find the job in database to get its city (most accurate)
2. **Slug Parsing**: Falls back to extracting city from slug pattern (job slugs typically end with city name, e.g., "senior-seo-manager-company-berlin")
3. **No Fallback**: If city cannot be determined, no jobs are shown (maintains geographic relevance)

**User Experience**:
- **City-Specific Only**: Title shows "Vacant SEO Jobs in {City}" with MapPin icon
- **Description**: "Check out these available SEO opportunities in {City}"
- **Job Cards**: Displays up to 6 jobs in responsive grid (1 col mobile, 2 col tablet, 3 col desktop)
- **View All Link**: Button to see all jobs in that city
- **No Irrelevant Jobs**: Only shows jobs from the same city - never shows jobs from other locations

**Smart Querying**:
- Only fetches active (non-expired) jobs
- Prioritizes featured jobs first
- Orders by creation date (newest first)
- Limits to 6 results for optimal page speed

#### Technical Implementation

**Client-Side Fetching Strategy** (Final Implementation):
- Server-side 404 page with client component for related jobs
- Uses `NotFoundRelatedJobs` client component to fetch jobs after page load
- `usePathname()` hook extracts slug from current URL path
- Queries Supabase client-side for related jobs based on detected city
- No server-side async operations in error boundaries (avoids Next.js limitations)

**Multiple Detection Strategies**:
1. **Primary**: Query database using slug to get exact city
2. **Fallback**: Parse city from slug pattern (last segment of slug)
3. **No Generic Fallback**: If city cannot be determined, shows nothing

**Why Client-Side**:
- Next.js 15 not-found.tsx pages have limitations with async Server Components
- Using `headers()` or `cookies()` in error boundaries causes reliability issues
- Client-side fetching after initial 404 render is more robust
- Maintains proper 404 HTTP status code
- Better compatibility with Next.js error handling

**Graceful Degradation**:
- Shows loading state while fetching related jobs
- Works even if database query fails
- No impact on 404 status code (still returns 404)
- Falls back gracefully if city cannot be determined

#### User Benefits
- Reduced bounce rate: Users find alternatives immediately
- Better engagement: Contextual job suggestions keep users on site
- Improved navigation: Direct path to city-specific jobs
- Enhanced UX: Turns dead-end 404 into discovery opportunity
- Fast initial page load with progressive enhancement

**Files Modified**:
- `src/app/job/[slug]/not-found.tsx` - Enhanced with client component integration
- `src/components/NotFoundRelatedJobs.tsx` - New client component for related jobs fetching
- `src/app/job/[slug]/page.tsx` - Simplified to call notFound() for expired jobs
